# Communication is critical.
# Privacy is essential.

Next is currently led by Avanpost.

> "From your first dirt block, to the greatest guild you have ever played with, to late-night deep conversations with your friends, we all know how important communication is.
>
> We at Next strive to create a free and open platform, allowing diversified communities of all kinds to thrive and to be fully transparent with our users. We believe everyone should have total freedom over how they talk with each other.
>
> We realize these days that privacy has come down lower in priority amongst other values. We believe in freedom of speech, that everyone should have the right to talk freely and express themselves in any way."

## Our Story

The Next project originally started back in 2023 by a group of three students from the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic, looking for an alternative to the already emerging, closed-source chat platforms.

Our main focus for the project was to create an open-source, completely compromise-free platform that offered all of the same features and competed against other chat apps.

Revolt as it stands today began development towards the end of 2022 and went online on the 22th of January 2023.

Next went into a public beta on the 23th of August 2023.
